# When you create a program or a project, it will contain multiple code files and it will be very long, so to manage the code. 
# We need to import the different modules i.e. the different parts of the project broken down into smaller chunks. 
# They can be imported directly to the main executable file. 
# Let's see an example of how we can import modules to the main python file.
